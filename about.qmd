Hi, my name is Isaac Michaud, and I am a research statistician who focuses on Bayesian experimental design and Uncertainty Quantification. Outside of research, I am a hobby tinker. I got started tinkering as a kid taking apart broken radios and VCRs. I like learning how to do things myself and being self-sufficient.
